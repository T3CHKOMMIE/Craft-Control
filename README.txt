INFO/License
******************************
Much care, time and testing have gone into this gadget. It does have some bugs but shoud NEVER effect anything but itself on the system.
That being said, bad things do happen. Backup reguarly and if Craft-Control ever starts to misbehave, Uninstall it, and download the most
current version from http://sourceforge.net/projects/craftcontrol/

the creator of this app (me)can be contacted by email at jules@t3chkommie.com
Be sure you add the address to your address book so that you can get replies. I usually reply within 24 hours.

The folder downloaded contains ALL of the code used by the widget. This is for your "open source" pleasure. All software with the exception
of the rcon folder was programmed, written, and owned by yours-truly. I will let you have at the code for you hacking pleasure. I only ask in 
return that credit is given where credit is due, and that you are NEVER to make any personal gain from my work. It is free to redestribute
if and only if there is absoutly no trade of goods or money. 

RCON- the rcon feature of this gadget is a wrapped exe from R3B0RN and was not created by Me. His program is available for download at
http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/852452-minecraft-rcon-tool-by-r3b0rn/

INSTALL
*********************************************
simply double click the craft-control.gadget file and install... it's that easy!

make sure it does not get renamed... it wont work if it does. 

if you dont want the code/files. after install, feel free to delete the entire downloaded folder. You dont need it anymore, its all in the gadget now ;)

PROBLEMS?
**********************************************
please email me if you are having problems with the widget. And be sure to follow these steps below:
1. are all instances of craft-control uninstalled?
2. is the name of the gadget still  craft-control.gaget?
3. mcgadget.exe is the program that retrives server info for you. It doesnt snoop, record or phone home. It only attempts to
contact the servers you tell it too. It will need permissions from windows to operate. Make sure it can get though your firewall.
4. is your system updated? make sure you are running IE8 or newer. gadgets use internet explorer... sorry, thats the way windows wants it.
5. sometimes norton thinks mcgadget.exe is a virus. it is not. if your AV software removes the exe, your widget will not work. reinstall widget. 
And allow mcgadget.exe to pass through the AV software.
6. Check the sourceforge site for updated gadgets. new features and bug fixes are hapening all the time.
7. if all else fails, email me. 

SIDENOTE
**********************************
craft control is a VERY beefy gadget. It does quite a bit more than your normal gadget. It will use up CPU and memory resources when it
contacts the servers you choose. IF you are running a very old pc or have a seriously slow internet connection, you might not want to use this.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
**********************************
These aren't really "requirements" but more like guidelines ;)
1. You need to be running Windows 7. Vista just sucks....
2. I would recommend 4 + gb of ram. Its cheap and easy to install... and possibly the best bang for your buck when doing upgrades to your system.
3. A CPU that was made within the last 3 years. Any I-Core whatevers shoudl be fine. Some newer/more expencive dual-cors should be ok. And and AMD
CPU newer that 4 years old should be ok too. Dont expect this to work on a Pentiam 4 with 512MB of ram.
4. A decent GPU. dont expect this to run great on a cheap 5 year old laptop.
5. The gadget uses UDP packets to talk GS4 protocol to MC servers. UDP is pretty fast, but not guarranteed. If you have a fast DSL or cable connection
you should be fine. DONT RUN THIS ON A DIAL-UP or cellular 3g 4g connections. IT CONSUMES YOUR DATA! if you have sprint... dont worry ;)
6. If you can play MC fine on your windows 7 machine, you shouldn't have a problem running this gadget at the same time.

I run this on very expencive, custom, development machines and servers. If you are expereincing a problem with performance on your laptop or desktop,
please email me your RAM, CPU configurtiona along with the MAKE and MODLE of your PC and some screenshots of your system performance or notes about whats happening.
If it seems that many people are having a hard time with loads, I will revisit my Big-O and try to make the code even MORE effecient. 

****************************************
WARNING
****************************************
This gadget is very dependent on files inside the craft-contro.gadget folder after it is installed. Unless you know exactly what is going on, and your probably don't,
DO NOT TOUCH THESE FILES. changing a value anywhere in the gadgets installed folder will more than likely break the gadget. feel free to hack and change tho. just 
remember about the "give credit where credit is due" thing.


LATEST UPDATE****************
2.1.3

iframe now scrollable. make sure your display is set yo 100% not 120% or 150%... the widget is supposed to be pretty tiny, and looks AWFUL at any screen display set to more than 100%
but not the iframe will atleast let you scroll around if you dont mind an ungle scroll bar.

updated backed with more efficent javascript. Should see less naming bugs and less dll bugs. 
2.0.1

URLS longer than 20 char (really need to be reconsidered)... but Craft-Control now strips the vowels out of them so that all data can be viewed nicely within the bounds
of the widget itself. The url should still be legiable. This bug fix goes out to visia101y who was monitoring a rather lengthy url. This is the best i can do sofar, I belive
it will fix most issues. I think stripping the vowels out of the URL will be clear enough to the monitor to remember what server it is while allowing the widget to remain
insize and prevent the Iframe from overflowing. The Iframe has had "scroll" turned off... cus its ugly. 

thanks for the bug message, report bugs at http://t3chkommie.com/?q=contact select craft-control from the drop down, and try including some screenshots. I will do my best
to put out an update as soon as i can fix it!
